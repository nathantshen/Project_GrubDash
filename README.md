# GrubDash Backend and API
GrubDash is a fictional company that operates an online food ordering and food delivery platform. 

For this Thinkful project, I set up a RESTful API, wrote custom validation functions, created route handlers, and built specific API endpoints. 
Of note, the front-end application was provided for this assignment.

## API Documentation
All requests return JSON response. All post requests require application/json body, and return JSON response.

### Endpoints for dishes:
**Get Dishes:** GET to `/dishes`
- Requests all existing dish data.
- Successful GET requests will return an array of JSON objects representing the saved dishes. The response from the server should look like the following:
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "d351db2b49b69679504652ea1cf38241",
      "name": "Dolcelatte and chickpea spaghetti",
      "description": "Spaghetti topped with a blend of dolcelatte and fresh chickpeas",
      "price": 19,
      "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1279330/pexels-photo-1279330.jpeg?h=530&w=350"
    }
    // ...
  ]

    "image_url": "some-valid-url",

```
{
  "data": {
    "id": "3c637d011d844ebab1205fef8a7e36ea",

      "mobileNumber": "(505) 143-3369",
      "status": "delivered",
      "dishes": [
        {
          "id": "d351db2b49b69679504652ea1cf38241",

        }
        // ...
      ]
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

**Create New Order:** POST to `/orders`
- POST request will be sent with a single JSON object like so:
```
{
  "data": {
    "deliverTo": "308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, NM",
    "mobileNumber": "(505) 143-3369",
    "status": "delivered",
    "dishes": [
      {
        "id": "d351db2b49b69679504652ea1cf38241",
        "name": "Dolcelatte and chickpea spaghetti",
        "description": "Spaghetti topped with a blend of dolcelatte and fresh chickpeas",
        "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/photos/1279330/pexels-photo-1279330.jpeg?h=530&w=350",
        "price": 19,
        "quantity": 2
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
- Note: Each dish in the Order's `dishes` property is a complete copy of the dish, rather than a reference to the dish by ID. This is so the order does not change 
retroactively if the dish data is updated some time after the order is created.
- Successful POST requests will return the newly created order as a JSON object. The response from the server should look like the following:
```
{
  "data": {
    "id": "5a887d326e83d3c5bdcbee398ea32aff",
    "deliverTo": "308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, NM",

        "price": 19,

      }
    ]
  }
}
```
